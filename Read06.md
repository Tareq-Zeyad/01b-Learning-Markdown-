## ***What is CSS***
### Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.

### CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.

## ***Adding CSS***
### Three Ways to Insert CSS:

- External CSS
- Internal CSS
- Inline CSS

#### *External style sheets are created in separate files with a .css extension. An external style sheet is simply a listing of CSS rules. It cannot contain HTML tags. The <link> tag, which goes in the head of an HTML page, is used to link to an external style sheet.*
#### *Rather than linking an external .css file, HTML files with an internal stylesheet include a set of rules in their head section. CSS rules are wrapped in <style> tags*
#### * Inline styles are applied directly to an element in your HTML code. They use the style attribute, followed by regular CSS properties.*
