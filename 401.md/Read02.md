# **Testing and Modules.**
## **TDD with Python**
### What is TDD ?
### TDD stands for Test-Driven Development which is a programming techniques strategy mainly done by using Unit tests which are pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code and they can be written at any time either.Also TDD encourages developers to focus on software design first then writing actual code to help prevent problems and bugs that could be potentially faced down the line.

### The TDD steps or Baby steps:
- ### **Arrange**: you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input).
- ### **Act**: here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour).
- ### **Assert**: after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting.

## **If name equals main**

### When the python interpreter is running a module as the main program, it sets the special name variable to have a value “main”. If this file is being imported from another module, name will be set to the module’s name. Module’s name is available as value to name global variable.

### It is the process in which a function calls itself repeatedly in order to solve an algorithm.
