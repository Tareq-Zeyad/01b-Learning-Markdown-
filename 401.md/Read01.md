### **The Big O Notations are ways to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm:**
- ### **O(1)**: describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.
- ### **O(N)**: O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.
- ### **O(N²)**: represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. 
- ### **O(2^N)**:  denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.

- ### Python is simple(i.e x = 23, means x equals 23, print(x) >>> 23).
- ### Names are assigned differently.
- ### Assignments never copy data.
- ### Mutable Aliasing.
- ### Immutable values can’t alias.
