## *Some advices & tips to help the developer pass the whiteboard technical intserview.*
<br>


### *The Advice: Communicate!*
### Talk with the person who interviews you and domenstrate the problem well, keep asking & to avoid stress the conversation might be friendly more than a formal one, the best piece of technical interview advice I have received and can impart upon you is to communicate, communicate, communicate! This may seem like an anti-climactic piece of advice, but I hope to be able to demonstrate to you that it’s actually the most important skill to prepare prior to an interview.
<br>

### *First, Restate the Question.*
### Try to get the overall idea from the question, like imagining what is the problem domain that am trying to cover !? Do you understand what they’re asking you to do? Prove it. Restate the question for them and seek affirmation. You might actually be surprised to find you don’t fully understand what they’re asking for perhaps the question is similar, but not the same, as a practice problem you have completed in the past.
<br>

### *Ask About Edge Cases.*
### When the solution might fail ? What scenarios may not be valid to give the desired output from that solution ?!
### Determine these cases, It’s still not time to dive right into coding the solution. Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem. Ask about them. In many cases, the interviewer hasn’t even thought about edge cases and will make something up. That’s great it shows you’re analytical and will work hard to try to prevent bugs (which often crop up due to edge cases).
<br>

### *Ask About Test Cases.*
### before dive in into coding, test your expected input & output. This is free and you should take advantage of it. Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass. Your interviewer might be expecting you to ask this question, so it might be necessary. But it’s also possible the interviewer was not expecting the question and will think “ah, this candidate knows about testing!”
<br>

### *Write Pseudocode.*
### One step before writing the actual code, is to describe it in normal language. Writing a Psedocode will give the ability to know if it make sense, again communicate with the interviewer about your steps.
<br>

### *Time for Coding.*
### Go ahead into translating the pesudocode & algorithm into actual coding. Write comments in code yo describe what you do, ask in a general form if you forget a syntax. And at the end ask for a feedback to enhance upcoming challenges.
