# Machine Learning Intro



# What is Machine Learning ?

Machine learning is the practice of teaching computers how to learn patterns from data, often for making decisions or predictions. For true machine learning, the computer must be able to learn patterns that it's not explicitly programmed to identify.


# Reallife Example of Machine Learning:


```
Example: the curious child
A young child is playing at home... And he sees a candle! He cautiously waddles over.

Out of curiosity, he sticks his hand over the candle flame.
"Ouch!," he yells, as he yanks his hand back.
"Hmm... that red and bright thing really hurts!"
Ooh a candle!
Ooh a candle!

Two days later, he's playing in the kitchen... And he sees a stove-top! Again, he cautiously waddles over.

He's curious again, and he's thinking about sticking his hand over it.
Suddenly, he notices that it's red and bright!
"Ahh..." he thinks to himself, "not today!"
He remembers that red and bright means pain, and he ignores the stove top.
To be clear, it's only machine learning because the child learned patterns from the candle.

He learned that the pattern of "red and bright means pain."
On the other hand, if he ignored the stove-top simply because his parents warned him, that'd be "explicit programming" instead of machine learning.
```

# Key Terminology


* Model - a set of patterns learned from data.

* Algorithm - a specific ML process used to train a model.

* Training data - the dataset from which the algorithm learns the model.

* Test data - a new dataset for reliably evaluating model performance.

* Features - Variables (columns) in the dataset used to train the model.

* Target variable - A specific variable you're trying to predict.

* Observations - Data points (rows) in the dataset.

# What are the 2 Types of Machine Learning ?

1. Supervised Learning

2. Unsupervised Learning


# What are The Core Concepts of Machine Learning ?

1. Exploratory Analysis

First, "get to know" the data. This step should be quick, efficient, and decisive.


2. Data Cleaning

Then, clean your data to avoid many common pitfalls. Better data beats fancier algorithms.


3. Feature Engineering

Next, help your algorithms "focus" on what's important by creating new features.


4. Algorithm Selection

Choose the best, most appropriate algorithms without wasting your time.


5. Model Training

Finally, train your models. This step is pretty formulaic once you've done the first
