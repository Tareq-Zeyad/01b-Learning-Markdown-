### *Project Jupyter describes JupyterLab as a next generation web based user interfaces for all products under the Jupyter ecosystem. It enables you to work seamlessly with notebook, editors and terminals in an extensible manner.*
### **Some of the important features of JupyterLab:**
- ### Code Console acts as scratchpad for running code interactively. It has full support for rich output and can be linked to a notebook kernel to log notebook activity.
- ### Any text file (Markdown, Python, R, LaTeX, etc.) can be run interactively in any Jupyter kernel.
- ### Notebook cell output can be shown into its own tab, or along with the notebook, enabling simple dashboards with interactive controls backed by a kernel
- ### Live editing of document reflects in other viewers such as editors or consoles. It is possible to have live preview of Markdown, Delimiter-separated Values, or Vega/Vega-Lite documents.
### *JupyterLab can handle many file formats (images, CSV, JSON, Markdown, PDF etc.). It also displays rich output in these formats. JupyterLab provides customizable keyboard shortcuts uses key maps from many well-known text editors.*

## **Numpy Tutorial. Data Analysis with Python**

### NumPy is a commonly used Python data analysis package. By using NumPy, you can speed up your workflow, and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem, like scikit-learn, that use NumPy under the hood. NumPy was originally developed in the mid 2000s, and arose from an even older package called Numeric. This longevity means that almost every data analysis or machine learning package for Python leverages NumPy in some way.
### *With NumPy, we work with multidimensional arrays. We’ll dive into all of the possible types of multidimensional arrays later on, but for now, we’ll focus on 2-dimensional arrays. A 2-dimensional array is also known as a matrix, and is something you should be familiar with. In fact, it’s just a different way of thinking about a list of lists. A matrix has rows and columns. By specifying a row number and a column number, we’re able to extract an element from a matrix.*
