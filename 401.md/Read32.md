# Permissions in Django REST Framework



### What are Permissions?

- In general, permissions are access details given by users or network administrators that define access rights to files on a network.

### Why are Permissions used ?

- Permissions are used to grant or deny access for different classes of users to different parts of the API.

### When do Permission checks run ?

- Permission checks are always run at the very start of the view, before any other code is allowed to proceed.

### How permissions are determined?

- Permissions in REST framework are always defined as a list of permission classes.

### When the permissions checks fail either a "403 Forbidden" or a "401 Unauthorized" response will be returned, according to the following rules:

- The request was successfully authenticated, but permission was denied. — An HTTP 403 Forbidden response will be returned.
- The request was not successfully authenticated, and the highest priority authentication class does not use WWW-Authenticate headers. — An HTTP 403 Forbidden response will be returned.
- The request was not successfully authenticated, and the highest priority authentication class does use WWW-Authenticate headers. — An HTTP 401 - Unauthorized response, with an appropriate WWW-Authenticate header will be returned.

### Setting the permission policy:

he default permission policy may be set globally, using the DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES setting. For example.

```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',
    ]
}
```

If not specified, this setting defaults to allowing unrestricted access:

```python
'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
   'rest_framework.permissions.AllowAny',
]
```

You can also set the authentication policy on a per-view, or per-viewset basis, using the APIView class-based views.

```python
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.views import APIView

class ExampleView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]

    def get(self, request, format=None):
        content = {
            'status': 'request was permitted'
        }
        return Response(content)
```
Or, if you're using the @api_view decorator with function based views.

```python
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view, permission_classes
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated
from rest_framework.response import Response

@api_view(['GET'])
@permission_classes([IsAuthenticated])
def example_view(request, format=None):
    content = {
        'status': 'request was permitted'
    }
    return Response(content)
```

Note: when you set new permission classes via the class attribute or decorators you're telling the view to ignore the default list set in the settings.py file.

Provided they inherit from rest_framework.permissions.BasePermission, permissions can be composed using standard Python bitwise operators. For example, IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly could be written:

```python
from rest_framework.permissions import BasePermission, IsAuthenticated, SAFE_METHODS
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.views import APIView

class ReadOnly(BasePermission):
    def has_permission(self, request, view):
        return request.method in SAFE_METHODS

class ExampleView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated|ReadOnly]

    def get(self, request, format=None):
        content = {
            'status': 'request was permitted'
        }
        return Response(content
```
