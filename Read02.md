## **Growth Mindset: A Breif** :star2:
### The best way to monitor your progress is to compare your new today self with yesterday, to recognize that all matters is to focus on your own development. Eventually Growth is a gradually process that can open the mind to new challanges, culters & knowledge through self learning, books & travel maybe. Through this journey you will be more tolerant, you can advise others. This is a state a closed mind doesn't want to experience, In summary I can say the comfort zone will ending up killing you slowly. Take an ACTION now.:smiley:
