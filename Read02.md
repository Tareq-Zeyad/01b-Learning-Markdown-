## **What is Git** ?
### Git is a *version control (VCS)* system for tracking changes to projects, the one with the Command Line Interface **CLI**, just like cmd in Windows. It can be downloaded locally thus you can work on it offline & ofcourse it will run on any OS.

### The main performance characteristics of Git are very strong when compared to many alternatives. *Committing* new changes, branching, merging and comparing past versions are all optimized for performance. The way it can import via *clonning* a reop & making edits through *git pull* makes it a smooth tool.

### Here is a Breif Summary of the Git commands:
#### 1- git add: add a file to the staging area
#### 2- git commit: commit changes to the repository
#### 3- git clone: clone a remote repository
#### 4- git push: push your committed changes to the remote repository
#### 5- git pull: download changes from remote repository
