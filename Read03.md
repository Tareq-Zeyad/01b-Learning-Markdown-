## **Wireframe**
### Once you need to build an object, prototype or even a house you'll get an Engineer or Designer to start planning a 2D-sketch for illustrate the geometry, shapes. Same in websites we have to imagine the over all design of the general look to our website we're building.
### So technically the design step could be done by hand all you need to have is paper & pen or with the help of software tools just like *Invision*.

### Here are some basic steps in order to make our website:
#### 1. Determine the subject, unleash your creative mind &        do all the neccessary research.
#### 2. Map out the user flow experience which means you should direct each icon when clicking it.
#### 3. Make some wires on your frame. Remember: you’re outlining and representing features and formats, not illustrating detail. So basically draft & sketch with putting in mind the function of each shape.
#### 4. Convert what you draw into a prototype, Once you’ve developed your wireframes in Sketch, you can import them into the industry-leading prototyping tool *InVision*.

## **HTML Basics**
### *HyperText Markup Language*
### HTML is the foundation of all web pages. Without HTML, you wouldn’t be able to organize text or add images or videos to your web pages. HTML is the beginning of everything you need to know to create engaging web pages!
### To summarize the most important things HTML uses commands called **Tags** to open a statement write a content then close it,
### <p> write content </p>
### In other terms:
#### 1. It is to structure a webpage.
#### 2. Wrap our text with tags.
#### 3. Not WYSIWYG.

## **Semantics**
### *what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?* 
### Simply, it is a meaningful tags or commands to do something & common Semantics shares with html & JS, for example:
#### 1. <footer>
#### 2. <header>
#### 3. <main>
#### 4. <li>
#### 5. <nav>
#### 6.<section>
