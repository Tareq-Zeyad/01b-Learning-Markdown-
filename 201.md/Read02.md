- The recommended one is External link where you can create new file with css extension & do all the Art.

### When it comes to CSS selectors it is useful to keep in mind:
- All CSS selectors are used to determine which tag element of the html file you want to style. We can use individual unique selector such as *id* or *Universial Selector* to choose all elements, or *Class Selector* for specific groups. or simple grab the tag name like *div* then open curly brackets {} type in the styling. These are summarize to:

## **Ch 2. Basic JavaScrpit Instructions**.
- Variables: are container that stores values to be evaluated when running a code involving them.

- Data Types:
These are to specify what data are you typing in order to distunguish between them like a string, boolean or list ...etc.

- Conditional Statements: Conditional statements control behavior in JavaScript and determine whether or not pieces of code can run.
- There are multiple different types of conditionals in JavaScript including:

1- “If” statements: where if a condition is true it is used to specify execution for a block of code.

2- “Else” statements: where if the same condition is false it specifies the execution for a block of code.

3- “Else if” statements: this specifies a new test if the first condition is false.

- Logical Operators & truth table, it used widely in conditions to expect which code is set to true & which is false.
