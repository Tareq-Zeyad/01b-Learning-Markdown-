## *Line Chart*.
### To draw a line chart, the first thing we need to do is create an element in our HTML in which Chart.js can draw our chart.
### in script tag we add the type of chart as **New Chart.Line**
### Inside the same script tags we need to create our data, in this instance it’s an object that contains labels for the base of our chart and datasets to describe the values on the chart.

## *Pie Chart*.
### The keyword for this chart is **New Chart.Pie**.
### This data is a little different to the line chart because the pie chart is simpler, we just need to supply a value and a color for each section.

- ### The **&lt;canvas&gt;** element can be styled just like any normal image (margin, border, background…).
