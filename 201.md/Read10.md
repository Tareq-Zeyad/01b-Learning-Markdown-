## **Ch. 10 Error Handling & Debugging**.
### Programming codes are like a puzzle, you have to expect the output correctly in order to write the code correctly. 
### The JavaScript interpreter evaluates one line of code at a time. When a statement needs a data from another function, it stacks the new function on top the current task.

### **Exception Handling**.
### *In JavaScript statement generates an error, then it throws an exception. At that point, the interpreter stops & looks for exception handling code*
### Exception handling is one of the powerful JavaScript features to handle errors and maintain a regular JavaScript code/program flow. An exception is an object with an explanation of what went amiss. Also, it discovers where the problem occurred. Errors occur due to mistakes made by developers, wrong input, or unforeseeable things. A few reasons why exceptions occur are listed below:
- ### Dividing a number by zero: This results in infinity, thus throwing an exception.
- ### When a requested file does not exist in the system.
- ### When the user provides the wrong input.
- ### When the network drops during communication.
