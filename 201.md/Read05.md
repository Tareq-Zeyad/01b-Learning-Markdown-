## **Ch. 11 Colors**
### Use colors to add styling and avoid dull user experience.

### Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.

- ### RGB Values: Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255.
- ### Hex Codes: Hex values represent values for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code.
- ### Color Names: Colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number.

- ### **Sans-Serif**: Sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design.

## **Blog Post**.
## **JPEG vs PNG vs GIF**.
### *The three most popular image formats for the web are JPG, GIF, and PNG. These formats represent very different approaches to the problem of delivering an image with minimum file size and download time.*
- ### **JPEG**:
### Use this format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth.
- ### **PNG**:
### And for this type of image format extension use it for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos.
- ### **GIF**:
- ### For this type use whenever there is Animation.

### **Compression**:
- ### Choosing the correct format and compression is a major factor that determines image size. 
- ### 

### **Transparency**:
- ### To make important illustrations such as logos more clear to the user Hence it is desirable, that the background of these logos and icons is made transparent so that a single image can be used over multiple background variations.

### **Colours**:
- ### There is a huge difference in number of colors that can be used in the 3 formats.
- ### JPEG images can support around 16 million colours. This is what makes them suitable for storing images of natural scenes.
- ### PNG images mainly have two modes — *PNG8* & *PNG24*. PNG8 can support up to 256 colours whereas PNG24 can handle up to 16 million colours like a JPEG image.
- ### GIF images are limited to 256 colours.

### **Animation**:
- ### Of course you saw a lot of memes on social media platform, some of these memes image can actually move lika a very very short video with repeated frames, Animation, in this case, refers to any change or movement in the image. It doesn’t necessarily have to have frame rates like an animated video, but essentially a part or the entire image changes with time.
