### *What is the World Wide Web ?*
#### An interconnected system of public webpages identified using URL's & accessible using the internet.
#### URL : stands for *uniform resource loacater.* one type of this is HTTP's: *hyper text transfer protocol secured*.
#### In order to this system of World Wide Web to work we need to :
#### 1- **Internet Service Provider (ISP):**
#### By using a web service provider such as *Zain* or *Orange* you will be able to access the Internet.
#### 2- **Web Browser:**
#### In order to view a web page or to surfe the web we need a software called Browser such like *Google Chrome*, *Firefox*, *Safari*,...etc. these tools will give us entrance to the webpage we want.
#### 3- **Web Server:**
#### These are physical devices where they can found locally & can connect globally to give the requested webpage from any country. 
#### 4- **Devices, obviously**:

### *How a website is created?*
#### I am writing at this moment using markdown tool which is part of the HTML: *hypertext markup language*, basically any site is consist of HTML & CSS.
#### 1- **HTML**:
#### Tells the browser what the content is: Texts, images, headlines & links ....etc, its the main foundation to start building the structure of any website.

## **Ch 1. Structure**
#### The first block to biuld any website will be through using HTML, by this tool we are able to struct the texting document of the site. Important outlines:
#### 1- Tags (Elements):
#### HTML uses opening & closing tags to determine the arrangment of the page, so any text lies between these tags is determined as head, title, body & so on.
#### 2- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element, attributes require a name and a value.
#### 3- Tags come in pairs &lt;opening&gt; &lt;/closing&gt;

## **Ch 8. Extra Markup**.
#### HTML is being updated into more improve & enhance versions than the previous ones, until now we are using HTML5 to build websites by more advanced ways. Important Outlines:
#### 1- HTML version.
#### once you see DOCTYPE HTML at the very beginning of the code, this indicates your using version HTML5.

#### 2- Comments.
#### sometimes its neccessary to make things easier to understand to your fellows or to write notes for your team leader. These are texts which will not run with the code they are not visible in the website, only on the code source.

#### 3- Escape Characters.
#### These are reserved characters and symbols in HTML that whenever they used it will run as a part of code. But what if we need to write it as a text !! here where escaping comes.

## **Ch 18. Process & Design**.
#### To make the most out of your website & to avoid any losses or shutting off the service, we need first to make a case study a 1st report contain all the vital info about:
- #### For whom is the website? , Who are going to use it ? from this point targeting the audience or users either individuals ,companies or goverment authority will help the team to design a website build specially for specific purpose & specific users.
- #### Starting from sketching on papers by hand, we imagine & construct the overall looking of the site by making the first step into **Wireframing** the website.
- #### Every click on every icon or feature must be organized through the **Site Map**.
