## **Ch 1. Structure**
#### The first block to biuld any website will be through using HTML, by this tool we are able to struct the texting document of the site. Important outlines:
#### 1- Tags (Elements):
#### HTML uses opening & closing tags to determine the arrangment of the page, so any text lies between these tags is determined as head, title, body & so on.
#### 2- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element, attributes require a name and a value.
#### 3- Tags come in pairs &lt;opening&gt; &lt;/closing&gt;

## **Ch 8. Extra Markup**.
#### HTML is being updated into more improve & enhance versions than the previous ones, until now we are using HTML5 to build websites by more advanced ways. Important Outlines:

#### sometimes its neccessary to make things easier to understand to your fellows or to write notes for your team leader. These are texts which will not run with the code they are not visible in the website, only on the code source.
