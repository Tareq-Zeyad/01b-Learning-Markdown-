## **Ch. 15 Layout.**
### CSS page layout techniques allow us to take elements contained in a web page and control where they are positioned relative to their default position in normal layout flow, the other elements around them, their parent container.
### We said earlier that CSS style consider each HTML text as a box (header,ul,body,....etc).
- ### **Normal flow**: is how the browser lays out HTML pages by default when you do nothing to control page layout.

- ### **Relative positioning**: Allows you to modify an element's position on the page, moving it relative to its position in normal flow, including making it overlap other elements on the page.

- ### **Absolute positioning**: oves an element completely out of the page's normal layout flow, like it is sitting on its own separate layer.
