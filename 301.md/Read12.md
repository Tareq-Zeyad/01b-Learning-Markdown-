|SQL databases have predefined schema      |   NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data. |
| SQL databases are vertically scalable     |  NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.  |

- ### *What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?*
###  For the complex query intensive environment
<br>

- ### *Give a real world example.*
### Ex:MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL
<br>

- ### *What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?*
### its better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data
<br>

- ### *Give a real world example.*
### Ex: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb
<br>

- ### *Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?*
### NoSQL database
<br>

- ### *Which type of database is best for scalability?*
