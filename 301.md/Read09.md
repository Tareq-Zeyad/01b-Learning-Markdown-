## **FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING.**
### **Functional Programming Concepts.**
- ### *What is functional programming?*
### It is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.
<br>

- ### *What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?*
###  Pure functions have no side-effects or hidden I/O, programs built using functional paradigm are easy to debug. Moreover, pure functions make writing concurrent applications easier.
<br>

- ### *What are the benefits of a pure function?*
### When the code is written using the functional programming style, a capable compiler is able to:
### 1- Memorize the results
### 2- Parallelize the instructions
### 3- Wait for evaluating results
<br>

- ### *What is immutability?*
### Variables are immutable i.e. it isnâ€™t possible to modify a variable once it has been initialized. Though we can create a new variable, modifying existing variables is not allowed.
<br>

- ### *What is Referential transparency?*
### An expression, in a program, may be replaced by its value (or anything having the same value) without changing the result of the program. This implies that methods should always return the same value for a given argument, without having any other effect.
