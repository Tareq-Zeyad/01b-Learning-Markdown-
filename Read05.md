### Logical Tables:
#### *AND*

- T && T = F             
- T && F = F 
- F && T = F
- F && F = F

#### *OR*
- T || T = T
- T || F = T
- F || T = T
- F || F = F

## **Loops**
### There is various types of loops & the common thing between is they all represnt a rpeated cycle that can runs over & over until the code is evaluated.
### *For loop*
### *A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.*

### * So whenever we need like a counter to repeat the code line till its exceeds, we use for loop.*
### *While loop*
### *The while statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. it will kept running the condtion until false value to ended it*
