### ***Functions***
#### As a part of Mathmatica expressions there is a lot of use of functions such as: Lograthmic, square, exponential, ...etc.
#### same in JavaScript we can describe Functions as: A reusable set of step bu step instructions, potentially based on input to potentially provide some output.

### ***Advantages of using Functions:***
- Functions make code reusable so we dont have to repeat.
- Functions let us define the code once, and then run the code wherever we need it.
- A well-named function communicates clearly its purpose.
- Functions help us avoid repeated codes.

### ***Control Flow***
#### Control flow is in computer science the order that the instructions or statements or functions are executed. In javascript, we read the code starting from the first line till the last line unless of course in the code there is some instructions or statements that changes that control flow.
#### In other words the way the code exceeds through a translator & since JavaScript is an interpreted language so its using an interpreter translator.
